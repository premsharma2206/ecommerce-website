# ecommerce-website
Here, I have created a basic e-commerce website using php, html, css, sql and bootstrap and deployed it on a wamp server. The website is based on my dad's shop and is named after it. It sells handicrafts, gifts and novelties. The websites displays various things available in the shop and allows customers to add items to their carts. Later, the customer can confirm their orders.
